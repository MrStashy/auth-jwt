## Question

What is Base64 and why is it used to construct a JWT?

## Answer

Base64 is how we send JWT across a network. It is the result of a string (in this case a JSON object) being translated into binary, and then into recognizeable characters (albeit not a recognizeable string). 

Base64 is used because it keeps the data size small.
